# weatherDashboard

## Description
In this assignment I used a third party weather API to get and display weather information for the current day and 5 days in the future. This involved using the fetch() function 
multiple times as well building out the core logic for the app using javascript. All the HTML and CSS is done from scratch. Past unique searches are saved in local storage and
the user can re-run past searches by clicking on the name of the city they previously searched.
